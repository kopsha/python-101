There are more pages on the web than people on Earth. And while I have not
checked, I am sure each on is full of original, high quality content that would
make our ancestors proud.

Most people access web pages through a browser, but as programmers we have other
methods... Today, we will learn how to use Python to send GET requests to web
servers, and then parse the response. This way, you can write software to read
websites for you, giving you more time to [...] browse the internet.

.. topic:: URL

    In a browser, you access a web page by typing the *URL* in the address bar.
    URL stands for **Uniform Resource Locator** and this string can hold a lot
    of information
    ``https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythonidae?filter=none&select=42#Relationship_with_humans``:

    - *Protocol*: https (e.g. http, ftp, etc.)
    - *Hostname*: en.wikipedia.org
    - *Path*: wiki/Pythonidae
    - *Querystring*: ?filter=none&select=42
    - *Fragment*: #Relationship_with_humans
