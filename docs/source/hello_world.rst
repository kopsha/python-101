hello world
###########

A way to show the world that we are civil.

Python is a clean and powerful programming language. You can use it to build websites, analyze data, create nice graphs or simply automate those boring repetitive tasks.

*todo: how about some screenshots ?*

It has become a programmer tradition that when you learn a new programming language, you start with a program that only says "hello".


the console
***********

First we need to verify if python is installed on our computer by opening the terminal application (for Windows users, type Win+R and then `cmd`).

Type in `python` and see what happens
    
.. code-block:: console

    macbook$ python
    Python 3.7.2 (default, Dec 27 2018, 07:35:52) 
    [Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> _

If you see a version number and a prompt, you're good to go. But if you see an error, you need to download and install python. I recommend to visit the `python comunity website <http://www.python.org/>`_ and download the latest python3 version.

Let's get more familiar with the python console. The easiest way you can interact with the python interpreter is through this console. Here you can *talk* directly to the core python and send your request.


Python as an interactive calculator
===================================

To get your feet wet with Python you can use the Python interpreter as a
calculator. You have the usual mathematical operators at your disposal, like

:``+``: addition,
:``-``: subtraction,
:``*``: multiplication,
:``/``: division,
:``**``: exponent,
:``//``: integer division, and
:``%``: modulus.

If you are not familiar with one of them just give it a try in the Python
interpreter --- python does not limit you to integer numbers, feel free to
try also floating point numbers or even strings.
You can also use brackets as you would use them in mathematical expressions.

Can you find out whether Python uses the proper mathematical rules with regards to the order of
execution of the operators.


For example:

.. code-block:: console
    :caption: why don't you try some numbers or an expression, or some text, be creative

    Python 3.7.2 (default, Dec 27 2018, 07:35:52) 
    [Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 
    >>> 10 
    10
    >>> 10 + 10
    20
    >>> 10 + 2 * 3  
    16
    >>> 'hello'
    'hello'
    >>> 1/2
    0.5
    >>> 1 + 2)
      File "<stdin>", line 1
        1 + 2)
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    >>> _

Observe that python tries to *understand* what we type, be it numbers, arithmetic operations or strings, computes the result and prints it back for us. However, if we accidentally type something that doesn't make sense, *Python* will do its best to point out the problem, but it will let us decide how and when we'll fix it.


saying hello
************

Open the python console and type ``print("Hello world!")`` then enter:

.. code-block:: console
    :caption: et voilÃ 

    >>> print("Hello world!")
    Hello world!
    >>> print(12)
    12
    >>> print(1 / 2)
    0
    >>> print(2 * 2)
    4
    >>> _



The ``print`` function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you are typing expresions in the python interpreter (remember the `>>>` prompter?) they are evaluated and the result is being printed on the screen for us. But when you are running the python program (see below) you need to be explicit to python about when to display an actual value or an expression.

The function you used in your first program, the :func:`print` function, behaves almost the same as the interpreter, it looks at our input, be it numbers, text, expression or even other functions, tries to understand it, evaluate it and then shows the result on the screen.



your first python program
*************************

Besides the interactive Python interpreter you can also write Python programs (sometimes called scripts).
A python program is a file that contains a list of python commands that can be executed from the command line interface.
A script can be really simple e.g. searching a text inside a file or it could be as complex as a complete car crash simulation.

Now we'll say *hello* using a python program instead of the interactive console, so exit python by typing ``quit()``

.. code-block:: console

    >>> quit()
    macbook$ _


Create a folder somewhere on your computer ``python_lessons``, open your favourite text editor and type in the same command we used earlier ``print("Hello world!")`` then save your file and call it ``01_hello_world.py``

All python programs all end in `.py`

The `01_` at the beginning is so all our files created in this tutorial are nicely sorted in a single folder

.. code-block:: console

    macbook ~ $ mkdir python_lessons
    macbook ~ $ cd python_lessons 
    macbook python_lessons $


And finally, execute this program by typing in *python* followed by the name of our file *01_hello_world.py*.
If you did everything correctly then your console should look like this:

.. code-block:: console

    macbook python_lessons $ python 01_hello_world.py
    Hello world!
    macbook python_lessons $ _


You got lucky, you just wrote your first python program.


the editor
**********

Now, that you've entered the world of python programming you may want to take it to the next level by using a text editor that was designed for editing python programs.

Even though there are many options available, I recommend you these two:

.. admonition::  sublime text

    is easier to use, it has all the features you may want and you don't event know them yet; it is light, fast and has a beautiful color theme.
    Long story short: it is *sublime*.

    You can get it from the `sublimetext website <https://www.sublimetext.com/3>`_

    And if you need any help have a look a this `video tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVkR1ZkNusI>`_.


.. admonition::  pycharm

    is just a bloated version of *sublime text* with the advantage that you could execute your programs directly in the editor or just line-by-line (read as *debug your code*) which could be useful when learning python to understand how complex structures are being executed.

    You can get it from `jetbrains website <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_.

    It also has an `educational version <https://www.jetbrains.com/education/#lang=python&role=learner>`_.
