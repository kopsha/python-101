Hello world
===========

A way to show the world that we are civil.

It has become a tradition that when you learn a new programming language, you start with a program that says "hello".


Why start with python?
######################

Python is a clean and powerful programming language.  You can use it to build websites, analyze data, write utilities, and create many other kinds of software.


to begin
========

* Check the installation in command prompt (Win+R then type `cmd`).

* Type `python` and press Enter

** if you see a version number and a prompt, you're good to go.

** but if you see an error, then you need to download and install python.

* Go to the site [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version.


and now, let's acomplish the task
=================================

* open the python console and type `print("Hello world!")` and press Enter. Et voila:

_TODO: add screenshots_

* Now we'll say 'hello' using a _python_ program instead of the _python interactive console_, so exit python by typing `quit()`

* create a folder somewhere on your computer `i_am_learning_python`

* open your favourite text editor and type in the same command we used earlier `print("Hello world!")`

* save your file and call it `01_hello_world.py`; _python programs all end in_ `.py`  

* the `01_` at the beginning is so all our files created in this tutorial are nicely sorted in a single folder

* now, run this program. To do this, type `python 01_hello_world.py` (notice the name of our file) and press Enter.

* There it is, our first python program.
