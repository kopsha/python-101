## Food for thought

* _It's just semantics._ Any program it is actually a new world, built from
scratch, where meaning is all there is. It is like writing a new story, which
happens in some kingdom far-far away and where you can (actually you must)
define everything.

* _The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create new semantic
level in which one can be absolutely precise._ (Edsger Dijkstra, "The Humble
Programmer")
